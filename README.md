## Installation and usage

I assume you have `node`, `npm` or `yarn` installed in your machine.

- Go to `/login` try to login with last name, date of birth, and a valid UK post code and click on next button.
- Next you'll see it's asking for which to send your one-time code to. (landline, mobile or email). Choose one and click on next.
- Next you'll see it asks to enter your one-time code. (We "assumed" is 0000) so enter 0000.
- Login
